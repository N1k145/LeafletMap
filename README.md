## LeafletMap

#### This is a fork of https://github.com/ssaring/sportstracker/tree/master/leafletmap

LeafletMap is a JavaFX component for displaying an OpenStreetMap based map
inside a JavaFX WebView by using the Leaflet JavaScript library.

There is a demo application inside the test directory which shows how to
use the LeafletMap component.

Both the LeafletMap component and the demo application are written in Kotlin.


#### Dependencies and used libraries

* Kotlin 1.2.0
* JavaSE 8 (tested with 8u151 and 9.0.1)
* Leaflet 1.0.3 (included)
    * Homepage: http://leafletjs.com/

    * Documentation: http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.3.html
* leaflet-color-markers (included, modified)

    * Homepage: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-kotlin
    * License: not specified


#### Status

* map viewer features:
    * supports OpenStreetMap, OpenCycleMap, HikeBikeMap, MtbMap and MapBox 
      layers, more can be added easily 
    * MapBox layer: a project specific token is required for MapBox! A test
      token for a limited time can be found in the Leaflet tutorial.
    * layers can be switched at runtime by the user
    * zoom and scale controls can be configured
    * scale supports metric and imperial units
    * markers in multiple colors can be displayed
    * tracks (routes) can be displayed
    * the map is zoomed properly to fit the track
    * tooltips can be displayed on the map
* colored markers are supported by the embedded "leaflet-color-markers" library
  (modified, e.g. added proper retina icon support)
* the leaflet and the leaflet-color-markers libraries are included locally, no
  download at runtime needed
* map viewer can be used offline, the route and the markers are shown without
  the map data
* the LeafletMapView component API can also be used from Java without problems
  (default method parameters are supported via @JvmOverloads)
* the demo application displays a GPS track read from a JSON file, the user can
  replay the track by using a position slider
